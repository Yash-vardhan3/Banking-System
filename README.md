Banking_System Project
Introduction
Banking_Sytem is a simple banking system implemented in C++. It provides basic functionalities such as creating accounts, depositing, withdrawing, transferring funds, and displaying customer and bank information. This project serves as a demonstration of object-oriented programming concepts in C++ and includes features like parallelism for deposit and withdrawal operations.

# Features
Account Management: Users can create accounts with initial balances.
Transaction Handling: Deposit, withdraw, and transfer funds between accounts.
Customer Information: Display customer information including name, address, email, and associated accounts.
Bank Information: Display overall bank information including the number of customers and their accounts.
Authentication: Users can authenticate with a username and password, with an optional two-factor authentication for added security.
Parallelism: Deposit and withdrawal operations can be executed in parallel threads for improved performance.
# Setup and Usage
Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/Yash-vardhan3/Banking_System.git
Navigate to the project directory: cd Banking_System
Compile the source code: g++ -o Banking_System main.cpp
Run the executable: ./Banking_System
# Usage
Upon running the program, follow the on-screen instructions to perform various banking operations.
Authenticate with your username and password.
Optionally, complete the two-factor authentication process for added security.
Choose from the menu options to deposit, withdraw, transfer funds, or view account and bank information.
# Requirements
C++ compiler (e.g., g++)
Standard C++ libraries
Future library for asynchronous operations (#include <future>)
Random code generation (#include <cstdlib> and #include <ctime>)
